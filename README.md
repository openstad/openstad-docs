Initially the software was developed in Amsterdam. It's currently actively used in Amsterdam & Den Haag. And soon also Haarlem, Utrecht & Alphen aan de Rein will go live with Participatory budget sites built with Openstad.

The ecosystem contains a CMS & sitebuilder that allows for pages to be build from scratch, an API and an admin panel that allows for multiple sites be created, copied and managed.

Check out the [Technical Documentation](technical/README.md) for the different servers we are managing and how to install the servers.
